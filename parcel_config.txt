/* Add Parcel to Project */ 
1. Install Node.js
2.npm init -y
3. npm install parcel-bundler --save-dev
4. Then, add these tasks scripts to your project, by modifying your package.json:
    {
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "parcel <your entry file>",
        "build": "parcel build <your entry file>"
    }
}

5. Add ".htmlnanorc.js" to the root of the project with this code:

    module.exports = {
        "minifySvg": false
    }
   Otherwise it gives an error ("tree.render is not a function") while building.

6. Then, you will be able to run it:

    # To run in development mode
    npm run dev

    # To run in production mode
    npm run build
